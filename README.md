# ThiefVR_bhaptics
bhaptics support for Thief VR

## Installation
1. Get the [MelonLoader installer](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation) and install the latest version on your game executable. Currently, the game only works with > 0.7.2, which is still in development, so you will need to "Enable nightly builds" in the installer.
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/floh-bhaptics/ThiefVR_bhaptics/releases/latest/download/ThiefVR_bhaptics.zip) of the mod and unzip the contents into the "Mods" directory in your game folder.
3. Start the game. There should be a heartbeat on startup to show you that the mod is working.
